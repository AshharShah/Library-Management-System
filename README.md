# ðŸ”µLibrary Managenment SystemðŸ”µ
ðŸ”¸This is a project I was given in my 2nd semester at my University, this program handles information of students and books and does various processes concerning it.

ðŸ”¹Here is how it works:
1) There are 4 things in the main menus from which you can choose(Student, List, Books, Library) and hence move on to the sub-menus regarding your selection which gives you a list of actions you can perform.
2) You can not assign the number 0 to any Book, Student or List as it refers to an empty data member.
3) Adding a book to a list does not add the book to the library but confines it to the list.
4) A Student can be assigned a maximum of 5 books incase he wants another book he would have to return one of his previously owned books.
5) You can add as many books, students or lists as you want as the program is fully based on dynamic memory allocation using the concept of linked lists.
